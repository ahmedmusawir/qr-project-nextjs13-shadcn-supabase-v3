/**
 * RootLayout: /app/layout.tsx
 *
 * This layout file is responsible for wrapping all pages within the application.
 * It sets up the ThemeProvider, global styles, and Toaster for notifications.
 * It also handles backend operations during the initial page load, such as
 * generating the ticket types JSON file.
 *
 * The `fetchAndGenerateTicketTypes` function from the services folder is invoked here
 * to ensure that the ticket types data is fetched and generated on the server side
 * before rendering any pages. This operation is cached using Next.js's revalidation
 * mechanism to prevent unnecessary API calls.
 *
 * This approach ensures a non-blocking, efficient process for handling backend
 * operations while keeping the client-side components lightweight.
